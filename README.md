# BoL Official autocomplete for Atom.

I have spent countless hours making this baby. He's not only a autocomplete for [Bot Of Legends](https://forum.botoflegends.com/), he's also a smart Atom autocomplete that has a brain. He knows when you what you want to type and it completes it for you. I switched from Sublime to Atom because Atom is open source: hackable to the core.
